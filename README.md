## How it Works

The Smart Contract Lottery system operates on a smart contract, which is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The smart contract ensures that the lottery is conducted fairly and transparently.<br/>

Participants purchase lottery tickets using cryptocurrency such as Ether, which is sent to the smart contract. When the lottery is closed, a random winner is selected by the smart contract based on a predetermined algorithm. The winnings are automatically distributed to the winner's wallet. <br/>
